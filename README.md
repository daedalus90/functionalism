## Functionalism: An Interface for Belief

### The River Bank
Through the night I drifted in and out of sleep. The fever kept my stints of sleep short. I woke on a riverbank. The dry, rounded, cobble was warm against my back. Thick evergreen forests ran along  the river. Slightly up river bank was a dirt road, it led from the dark, and dense, forest downstream to an old single lane bridge which crossed the river upstream from where I lay. It was comfortable, but I knew I had to cross that bridge and continue up that forest road. 

It was all very Jungian, but when I woke up, Functionalism was top of mind, and it seemed time to cross that bridge.

### The Purpose of Life
There’s a purpose to every life, but how can that be given the variety of experiences had by individuals throughout time and space? The Alaskan fisherman, the African child dying from malaria, the billionaire Russian oligarch, these lives are all equally purposeful.

Our elders have always lectured us, sharing knowledge from their experiences, yet for the most part we don’t heed their warnings. Only after experiencing things firsthand do, we truly understand, no amount of advice and secondhand knowledge can replace the simple act of living through it yourself.

Experience is the only answer.

The purpose of life is simply experiencing it. No experience is more valuable than another, and no two experiences are the same. To truly know itself, the Universe must experience itself as throughly as possible. Each experience brings the Universe closer to true understanding.

### The Trilogy
While every experience has its purpose, there are steps we can take to minimize unnecessary pain and suffering. By focusing on these three central tenants, we can live a purposeful life, without senseless suffering.

#### Separation from the ego
An individual has no control over the time, place, or body they are born into. Despite this, we equate these things with self-worth. The individual is an illusion, a necessary and useful illusion, but in the end, we’re all one in the same.

If we take two glasses: a priceless goblet, and an old jar, and scoop water from the ocean with each, then after some time has passed, return the water to the ocean, did the value of the water, or ocean, change?

Don’t let the ego trick you into thinking it’s anything more than a vehicle, a tool, a means to an end, a way for the infinite to experience the finite.

#### Experincing The Individual
We’re here for a reason; here to have completely unique experiences. No novel experience is more valuable than another, but there’s no need to have experiences and learn lessons we’ve already learned, especially those which are painful. An fulfilling life can be lived through maximizing personal growth, while minimizing suffering. Some lessons are can only be written in blood, but if the same can be written in ink, blood is better saved.

#### Enabling Others
The separation between each other, and the universe, is an illusion. Living a fulfilling life benefits us all, and enabling others benefits you. When you limit others, you limit yourself. We all need the freedom, and opportunity to live, die, help, hurt, succeed, and make mistakes; the society we build should reflect this. 

### Functionalism
So far, I’ve presented nothing particularly novel.
Functionalism is not the above ideas in isolation. It is the combination of these aspirational ideas and the process of starting with a framework, then working backwards to find a belief system that will help you reach these ideas.

Functionalism is the realization that the human psyche doesn’t thrive with a worldview dominated by relativism. It’s not necessarily the rejection of relativism, but the acceptance of the fact that having a concrete belief system has a functional purpose.

Functionalism borrows its name and inspiration from fundamental mathematical ideas. Like a function in mathematics, Functionalism serves as a map, your belief system is the input used to navigate this map.

Functionalism requires a belief system, either of your own crafting, or one which is compatible with The Trilogy. Functional Christianity: *f(Christianity)*, Functional Buddhism: *f(Buddhism)*, Functional Anything: *f(x)*. Find the stories, god(s), and figures that guide you through a life of experience.
